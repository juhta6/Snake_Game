Hello!

This game uses ncurses library, so in order to make it work you have to
install ncurses to your system. I made a shortcut file for installation 
to make it easier. Just run "installNcurses.sh".

When that is done, you can execute "run.sh" file.

##NOTE##
#both sh files are executable, so running via terminal is not required
